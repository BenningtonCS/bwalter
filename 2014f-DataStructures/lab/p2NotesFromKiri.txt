Notes for Problem 2:

Your comments are lovely and excellent and clear and I'm impressed with
your use of float.  I now understand how do to that.

I should really have more comments, but mostly I'm enjoying the really
clean way you moved through all of this.  I might expand some of your
lines to multiple lines for clarity (line 28 stands out to me), but nothing
is really unclear, so.... Feel free to ask someone more advanced than I
for notes, if you would like!
