1.6. When the constructor is made private, the compiler throws an error saying that the class is private and cannot be created.

2.2. It gives the methods and attributes associated with Student

2.4. stu and bstu have the same methods associated with them. They do seem to refer to the same initial object, as bstu is a copy of stu, just type casted to become a BenningtonStudent (and stu is a BenningtonStudent type casted to be just a Student). What is also interesting to note is my compiler warns that type casting BenningtonStudent to Student is redundant.

2.5. Yes, when calling methods associated with Student from BenningtonStudent, it doesn't know what to call as those methods are no longer a part of BenningtonStudent.

2a.3. Yes, protected attributes and methods are inherited by child classes

2a.4. No, trying to access protected methods and attributes from outside of inherited classes is akin to trying to access something that is set to private.

2b. java.io.FileInputStream is derived from InputStream, which is an abstract class meaning that InputStream is a class which is meant only to be used as a common parent class for multiple other classes. FileInputStream seems to overwrite most of the read(...) functions.

In java.util, Vector extends from Abstract list, which extends from AbstractCollection, which extends from Collection, which extends from Iterable which I cannot find in IntelliJ. I imagine that this hierarchy exists because each iteration gets more and more specific to one certain thing. For example, there can be many things that are considered a 'collection', one of them being a list (AbstractList). There are then several things that can be considered lists, such as Vectors.

3.4. There are a lot of methods that you can call, including getCause(), getMessage(), getStackTrace(), etc. that allow the user to track down the error and can make troubleshooting easier.

3.5. MalformedURLException is extended from IOException, which is extended from Exception, which should be in java.io, but I can't find it in IntelliJ for some reason.
