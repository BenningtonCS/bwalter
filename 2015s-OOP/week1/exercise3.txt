Exercise 3

java -> util -> LinkedList

In exercise 1, I wondered about the feasibility of making data structures, such as linked lists, as objects. As everything is an object in Java, it would follow that an implementation of a linked list must be an object as well, even if it's not more efficient (or "better" in general, whatever "better" means in this case) to do so this way.

LinkedList is a class which seems to be inherited from AbstractSequentialList. This class has methods for every operation one would want to use with a linked list: it has functions to had a new node to the head of the list as well as to the end, before a selected node, and methods for removing (unlinking, as they call it) nodes from the list. There are additional functions to check the value of a node at a certain index, as well as finding the index of a certain value.
