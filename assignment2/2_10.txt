Problem 2.10: What is the difference between num[j] and *(num+j)?

num[j] gives the jth element of an array called 'num'. *(num+j) points to a place in memory that is j places past the first part in memory.

Same as num is the same as &num[0], num[j] is the same as *(num+j). This can be seen in the two following lines of code:

    char num[] = "hello";
    if (num[2] == *(num+2)) printf("True\n");

This prints out True.
