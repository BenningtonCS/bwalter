Ah yes, nice code. Verry nice code... wait, your getMoney/cents 
functions take a float instead of a pointer to a money struct, 
why?

In order to fix your getMoney problem (the float sometimes 'rounding'
inappropriately) consider reading dollars and cents into two int 
variables rather than one float: i.e. scanf("%d.%d",&dollars,&cents). 

In makeChange you don't need to do modulus math, by the magic of int
division 79/25 == 3.
