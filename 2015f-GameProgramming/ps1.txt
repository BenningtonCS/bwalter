1. How do you center your Scene View around an object?

    Select the object with the mouse and hit 'f'


2. Where is the camera positioned in (x,y,z) by default?

    0,1,-10

3. If we have a plane at (0,0,0), where should a sphere of scale (1,1,1) be so it just rests on top of the center of the plane? (Make it happen!)


4. At what rotation (x,y,z values) does the Directional Light point straight down?
    
    90, 0, 0

5. What happens when you scale the y value of the plane?

    The plane is moved up in space.


6. What happens to the scene when you change the position of the light?

    When the directional light is moved, the lighting of the area stays the same. A point light would cause the illumination to differ based on its location.


7. What happens when you change things while in Play Mode then exit Play Mode?

    They go back to how they were before you entered play mode.

8. What happens in the Game View when you change Clipping Planes on the Main Camera? What do you think Clipping Planes does?
